# üîπ vCPUs (Virtual CPUs) in Virtualization

## üìå What is a vCPU?

- A **vCPU (Virtual CPU)** is a virtual version of a physical CPU core.
- It's **assigned to a Virtual Machine (VM)** by the **hypervisor**.
- The VM thinks the vCPU is a real processor ‚Äî but it's really just software.

> Think of a vCPU as a **"pretend CPU"** that the hypervisor maps to a **real CPU core** on the host machine.

## üß∞ Why Do We Need vCPUs?

| Benefit           | Explanation                                                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üé≠ Isolation     | Each VM gets its own vCPUs, so they don't interfere with each other.          |
| üéöÔ∏è Control       | You can assign more or fewer vCPUs to VMs depending on their workload.        |
| üì¶ Portability   | VMs can move between different hosts and still work the same.                 |
| üîÅ Flexibility   | You can run many VMs on one host by sharing physical CPUs (overcommitting).   |
| üîí Security      | Keeps each VM's processes separate for better security and stability.         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Do vCPUs Work?

- **vCPUs are not physical.** They rely on **pCPUs (physical CPUs)** to run.
- The **hypervisor** manages when and where each vCPU runs on a real core.
- A vCPU can **share a physical core** with other vCPUs (depending on workload and scheduler).

### üîÑ Real Example:
> A server with **8 cores and Hyper-Threading = 16 threads**  
> You can run **4 VMs**, each with **4 vCPUs**  
> Total = 16 vCPUs mapped to 16 real threads

---

## ü§î Why Can't vCPUs Run Alone?

Because they're just **software representations**.  
They **don't have electrical circuits** to actually execute instructions.

**Only real CPUs (pCPUs)** can do the actual computing.  
The vCPU just tells the hypervisor:  
üó£Ô∏è `Hey! Run this task for me on a real CPU.`

---

## üí° What is a Hypervisor?

The **hypervisor** is the software that:
- Runs on the physical host
- Creates and manages VMs
- Schedules vCPUs to use physical CPU time

### Examples of Hypervisors:
- VMware ESXi
- Microsoft Hyper-V
- KVM (Linux)
- Citrix Hypervisor (formerly XenServer)

## üßÆ 1 vCPU vs. Multiple vCPUs

| Setup         | Use Case                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **1 vCPU**     | Small apps, light tasks, basic services   |
| **2-4 vCPUs**  | Web servers, office applications          |
| **4+ vCPUs**   | Databases, video processing, game servers |

> üìù **More vCPUs ‚â† Always Better**  
> If your host doesn't have enough physical CPU power, giving VMs too many vCPUs can **slow things down**.

---

## üîÄ vCPU Scheduling

The hypervisor uses scheduling to decide **which vCPU runs when**:

| Scheduler Type        | Description                                     |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Fair Scheduler        | Gives equal time to all VMs                     |
| Priority Scheduler    | Favors high-priority VMs                        |
| Real-Time Scheduler   | For time-sensitive apps                         |
| Work-Conserving       | Makes sure the CPU is never idle if work exists |

---

## ü§ù Gang Scheduling (Simple View)

- All vCPUs of a VM are scheduled to run **at the same time**.
- Good for parallel programs.
- Not efficient if not all vCPUs are doing something.

---

## üß¨ What is Hyper-Threading?

- Intel tech that makes **1 physical core look like 2 logical cores**.
- Helps handle more tasks simultaneously.
- In virtualization, these logical cores can be used as **vCPUs**.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Hypervisor Examples

### ‚úÖ Microsoft Hyper-V
- Uses a **partition-based scheduler**
- Managed by a **Root Partition**

### ‚úÖ VMware vSphere / ESXi
- Advanced features like:
  - **vMotion** (move VMs while running)
  - **DRS** (resource balancing)
  - **HA** (auto-restart on failure)

### ‚úÖ Citrix Hypervisor (Xen-based)
- Often used for virtual desktops
- Supports live migration and GPU sharing

## üß™ Binary Translation vs. Hardware Virtualization

| Feature                     | Binary Translation               | Hardware-Assisted Virtualization |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Speed                      | Slower                           | Faster                           |
| Uses Real CPU Instructions | No (translates them)             | Yes (direct execution)           |
| Common Today?              | Rare (used in early systems)     | Yes (modern standard)            |

## üìå Summary

- A **vCPU** is a **virtual copy of a CPU core**, managed by a hypervisor.
- It **needs a real CPU (pCPU)** to execute tasks.
- vCPUs enable multiple VMs to share the same hardware efficiently.
- The hypervisor manages **scheduling**, **resource control**, and **isolation**.
