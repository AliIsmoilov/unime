# üîπ Virtual Machine (VM) Migration

VM migration is the process of moving a virtual machine (VM) from one physical host to another.  
It is commonly used for:

- Load balancing
- Performance optimization
- Maintenance
- High availability

## üîπ Goals of Data Center Migration

Key goals of migrating infrastructure within or between data centers include:

| Goal              | Description                                                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consolidation** | Reduce physical servers by centralizing workloads on fewer powerful machines. |
| **Colocation**    | Move infrastructure to third-party data centers to cut operational costs.     |
| **Load Balancing**| Distribute workloads evenly to optimize resource use and performance.         |
| **Maintenance**   | Allow updates or repairs with minimal disruption via temporary VM migration.  |

## üîπ Migration vs Replication

| Feature       | **Migration**                                         | **Replication**                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**   | Moves a VM from one host to another                   | Copies a VM to another location                        |
| **Frequency** | One-time or ad-hoc                                    | Continuous or scheduled                                |
| **Downtime**  | Possible (except during live migration)               | Typically none                                         |
| **Source VM** | Stops or moves                                        | Remains active                                         |
| **Target VM** | Becomes primary                                       | Used as backup or for failover                         |
| **Use Case**  | Maintenance, upgrades, load balancing                 | Disaster recovery, high availability                   |
| **Examples**  | VMware vMotion, Hyper-V Live Migration                | Veeam, Zerto, Azure Site Recovery                      |

## üîπ Types of VM Migration

### 1. **Cold Migration**
- **Definition**: Moving a **powered-off** VM between hosts.
- **Use Case**: Planned maintenance or long-term relocation.
- **Steps** (e.g., VMware):
  - Shut down VM.
  - Transfer files (disks, configs) to new host.
  - Register VM on new host.
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Simple, no runtime errors.  
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Full downtime required.

---

### 2. **Live Migration** (Hot / Real-Time)
- **Definition**: Moving a **running** VM between hosts with minimal disruption.
- **Key Features**:
  - Millisecond-level downtime.
  - Network connections remain intact.
  - Seamless to end users and applications.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Load distribution
  - Hardware upgrades
  - High-availability operations
- **Tools**: VMware vMotion, Microsoft Hyper-V, KVM

## üîπ Live Migration Techniques

### 1. **Pre-Copy Migration**
- **Process**:
  1. VM continues running while memory pages are copied.
  2. Dirty pages are recopied in iterations.
  3. Final transfer and VM resumes on destination.
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Minimal downtime, widely adopted.
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Slower with high memory changes, higher network usage.

---

### 2. **Post-Copy Migration**
- **Process**:
  1. VM paused immediately, CPU state copied.
  2. VM resumes at destination.
  3. Memory pages fetched from source as needed.
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Faster total migration, lower bandwidth.
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Higher failure risk if source becomes unavailable; initial slowness.

---

### 3. **Hybrid Migration (Pre + Post-Copy)**
- **Process**:
  - Starts with pre-copy to reduce memory size.
  - Switches to post-copy for final phase.
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Balances speed, risk, and downtime.
- ‚ùå **Cons**: More complex to manage and implement.

### üî∏ Technique Comparison

| Technique     | Downtime     | Performance Impact    | Network Usage      | Source Failure Risk   |
|---------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Pre-Copy**  | Very Low     | Low                   | High (re-transfers)| Low                   |
| **Post-Copy** | Low          | Medium (initial delay)| Low                | High                  |
| **Hybrid**    | Very Low     | Balanced              | Balanced           | Medium                |
