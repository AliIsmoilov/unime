# Cloud Computing Overview

## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and moreâ€”over the internet (`the cloud`) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. Instead of owning their own computing infrastructure, companies can rent access to anything from applications to storage from a cloud service provider.

## Types of Cloud Deployment Models

### 1. **Private Cloud**
- Used exclusively by one organization.
- Infrastructure is maintained either internally or by a third party.
- Offers more control and security.

### 2. **Public Cloud**
- Services are delivered over the public internet.
- Shared resources among multiple users.
- Cost-effective and scalable.
- Examples: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud.

### 3. **Hybrid Cloud**
- Combines both private and public cloud environments.
- Allows data and applications to move between the two.
- Offers greater flexibility and more deployment options.

### 4. **Community Cloud**
- Shared infrastructure between several organizations with common concerns (security, compliance, etc.).
- Managed internally or by a third-party.
- Example: A group of hospitals sharing a cloud for medical records.

## Types of Cloud Service Models

### 1. **IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service**
- Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.
- Users rent servers, storage, and networking.
- Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.

### 2. **PaaS - Platform as a Service**
- Provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the infrastructure.
- Example: Google App Engine, Heroku.

### 3. **SaaS - Software as a Service**
- Delivers software applications over the internet.
- Accessible via web browsers without installation.
- Example: Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox.
