                                        Real-Time CPU Scheduling

What is a Real-Time Process?
    •   A real-time process is one where the correctness of the system depends not only
        on the logical computation but also on the time which results are produced.
    •   Real-time processes are special because they have a strict timing requirements.
    •   The OS needs to schedule them in a way that ensures deadlines are met - which is very
        different than normal processes are handled.


Two main Types of Real-Time processes:
    •   Hard-Real Time: Missing a deadline is catastrophic (e.g pacemakers and medical devices)
    •   Soft-Real Time: Missing a deadline is tolerable occasionally (e.g video streaming, online gaming)



How OS Schedules Real-Time processes?
    •   OS use real-time scheduling algorithms that are desingned to prioritize tasks based on 
        their timing constraints.
    •   For real-time scheduling, scheduler must support preemptive, priority based scheduling
    
    Key concepts:
        •   Deadline: The time which task must be completed.
        •   Period: How often task repeats
        •   Execution Time: Time it takes for a task to finish once started.
        •   Priority: Determines which task gets the CPU first.


Real-Time scheduling algorithms:

    1.Earliest Deadline First (EDF)
        • Task with the closest deadline runs first.
    
    2. Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)
        • Shorter period → higher priority.
        • Simple and efficient for periodic tasks.
