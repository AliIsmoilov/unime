                                                Scheduling

What is CPU scheduler?
    •   A CPU scheduler is a fundamental component of an operating system responsible
        for deciding which process gets to use the CPU.
        Since mist systems has more processes than CPU cores, the scheduler ensures
        fairness, efficiency and responsiveness by allocating CPU time among processes
    

What CPU scheduler does?
    •   Selects the process from the ready queue(processes waiting for CPU time)
    •   Allocates CPU to one process
    •   Performs this task repeteadly and quickly


Types of CPU Scheduling

    1.  First-Come, First Served(FCFS):
            • Processes sorted by order they arrive
            • can lead to the convoy effect (long waiting times)
    
    2.  Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF):
            • Pick the process with shortest burst time
            • Can lead to starvation for long jobs
    
    3.  Priority Scheduling:
            • Each process has a priority, CPU goes by priority order
            • Needs aging to prevent starvation

                                    Preemptive VS Non-Preemptive scheduling

Preemptive Scheduling

    Definition: 
        In preemptive scheduling, the operating system can interrupt a currently running process
        in order to assign the CPU to another process - usually one with higher priority.

    Characteristics:
        •   The CPU can be taken away from running process
        •   Allows better responsiveness
        •   Ensures that hihg-priority tasks don't wait too long

    Real Life Example:
        Imagine you're watching a movie on your laptop (Process A), and then you get a video call (Process B, higher priority). 
        The system pauses the movie and gives priority to the call.       
    


Non-preemptive Scheduling
    Definition:
        In non-preemptive scheduling, once a process starts execution, it runs until completion or
        until it blocks itself, and CPU is not taken away by force.
   
    Characteristics:
        •   Simple to implement
        •   no interruption once a process is running
        •   Might lead to poor responsiveness for hihg-priority tasks        

     Real Life Example:
        You start printing a long document (Process A), and even if another urgent task 
        comes in (Process B), it has to wait until the printing is done.
