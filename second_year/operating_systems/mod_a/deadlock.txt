What is Deadlock?
    A deadlock is a situation in computing where two or more processes are unable to proceed 
    because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. 
    In simpler terms, it's like a standoff where no one can move forward 
    because everyone is holding something the others need.

Real life example(ChatGPT):
    Imagine two people trying to eat spaghetti, but each needs two forks. 
    Person A has fork 1, and Person B has fork 2. 
    Neither can eat until they have both forks, but neither is willing to give up the fork they already have.
    So they both just sit there — stuck. That's a deadlock.


Deadlock Characterization
    Deadlock can arise if four conditions hold simultaneously:
        • Mutual exclusion: only one thread at a time can use a resource
        • Hold and wait: a thread holding at least one resource is waiting to
          acquire additional resources held by other threads
        • No preemption: Resources can not be forcibly taken away from process
        • Circular wait: A closed chain of processes exists where each process holds a resource 
          and waits for another held by the next.

Deadlock Detection
    •   Deadlock detection is a method used in operating systems to identify when a deadlock 
        has occurred among processes and resources. Instead of preventing or avoiding deadlocks, 
        this strategy lets them happen, and then the system checks for them and takes steps to recover.
    •   There are several techniques to detect deadlocks like: Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)


What Is a Resource-Allocation Graph (RAG)?
    •   A Resource-Allocation Graph is a visual representation of the relationships 
        between processes and resources in a system.
    •   It is technique to detect deadlocks by showing which process are holding
        or waiting for which resources.
    •   You can see the example of RAG here:

What is Deadlock Prevention?
    •   Deadlock Prevention is a technique that ensures at least one of the four 
        necessary conditions for a deadlock can never occur. 
    •   By eliminating one or more of these conditions, the system prevents deadlocks from ever happening.
    •   Above we talked about four necessary conditions for a deadlock.


    1. Prevent Mutual Exclusion
        • Idea: Allow resources to be shared.
        • Reality: Only works for sharable resources like read-only files. 
            Not possible for non-sharable resources (e.g., printers).
        • Example: Two processes reading from the same file.
    
    2. Prevent Hold and Wait
        • Idea: Require a process to request all resources at once before execution starts.
        • Pros: Eliminates waiting while holding.
        • Cons: May lead to low resource utilization and starvation.
        • Example: Process A requests both printer and scanner at the beginning. 
            If both are not available, it waits without holding anything.
    
    3. Prevent No Preemption
        • Idea: If a process is holding some resources and requests another not available, 
            take back the currently held resources.
        • Used in: Systems where resources can be saved/restored safely (e.g., CPU, memory).
        • Example: In CPU scheduling, if a process needs more memory than available, 
            take away its CPU time and put it back in the queue.

    4. Prevent Circular Wait
        • Idea: Put a strict ordering on resources. Each process must request resources in that order.
        • Example: Number all resources (R1, R2, R3...), and require that a process can request 
            R2 only if it already holds R1.

What is Banker's Algorithm?
    • It is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra
    • It ensures that a system does not enter a deadlock state by simulating 
        the allocation of resources to processes and checking if the system remains 
        in a safe state after the allocation.   


Why is it called  "Banker's" Algorithm?
    Because it reminds how a banker might decide whether to approve a loan:
        • Banker checks if they can still satisfy the maximum possible future requests 
            of all customers after giving out a loan.
        • If not, the loan (resource request) is denied.

What is Deadlock Recovery?
    • Once a deadlock is detected, the system needs to break the cycle 
        so that processes can continue to works
    • There are two main approaches: Process termination, Resource preemption


1. Process Termination
    • Kill one or more processes involved in the deadlock.
    • Two options:
        • Abort all deadlocked processes: quick but causes data loss.
        • Abort one at a time until the deadlock breaks.

    • Which process to kill?
        • Based on priority
        • Process completion time
        • How many other processes it would free

2. Resource Preemption
    • Temporarily take resources away from one or more processes.
    • The preempted process is either:
        • Rolled back to a safe state and restarted later
        • Or paused until resources are available again

    • Considerations:
        • Which resources to take?
        • From which process?
