WHAT IS INTERNET?
    The internet, sometimes simply called the net, 
    is a worldwide system of interconnected computer networks and electronic devices that 
    communicate with each other using an established set of protocols. 
    The internet was conceived by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the U.S. government in 1969.
    It connects millions of computers, webpages, websites, and servers.
    Internet structure: a “network of networks”
    hosts connect to Internet via access Internet Service Providers (ISPs)


HISTORY OF THE INTERNET
    The Internet came in the year 1960 with the creation of the 
    first working model called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency).    
    It allowed multiple computers to work on a single network which was their biggest achievement at that time.
    In october 1969, using ARPANET first message was transferred from one computer to another.
    After that technology continues to grow. 

How Does the Internet Work?
    Many people think that the Internet does not require any physical cables to work,
    but that's not true.
    The internet is set up with the help of physical optical fiber data transmission cables 
    or copper wires and various other networking mediums like LAN, WAN, MAN, etc.
    It does not matter 2G or 4G, for accessing the Internet require these physical cable setups to access the Internet.

Network edge:
    ▪ hosts: clients and servers
    ▪ servers often in data centers
Access networks, physical media:
    ▪ wired, wireless communication links
Network core:
    ▪ interconnected routers
    ▪ network of networks

What is Packet-Switching?
    Packet switching is a method of transmitting data over a network by breaking 
    it into smaller packets and sending them separately. 
    The packets are then reassembled at their destination

What is Packet transmission delay?
    Packet transmission delay is the time it takes to send a packet of data over a network link. 
    It's also known as packetization delay.

    Factors that affect packet transmission delay
        ▪ Packet size: The larger the packet, the longer the transmission delay 
        ▪ Link speed: The faster the link, the shorter the transmission delay 
        ▪ Number of active sessions: The physical layer processes packets in FIFO order
        ▪ You can calculate packet transmition delay using the formula: Packet Size / Link Speed


What is store-and-forward?
    ▪ store-and-forward is a telecommunications technique that stores and verifies data packets 
    before sending them to the next node. This process ensures that data packets are error-free 
    and can be delivered to the correct destination

What is Circuit Switching?
    ▪ Circuit switching is method for establishing a connection between two endpoints
    for the duration of communication sessions.
    ▪ Mostly used for voices and telephone networks
    ▪ Frequency division multiplexing (FDM) and time division multiplexing (TDM) are
    2 types of Circuit Switching which uses different methods to share a channel.
 

Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM):
    ▪ optical, electromagnetic frequencies divided into (narrow) frequency bands
    ▪ each call allocated its own band, can transmit at max rate of that narrow band
    ▪ each station assigns fixed frequency band 

Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):
    ▪ time divided into slots
    ▪ time divided into equal size slots

How do packet delay and loss occur?
    ▪ packet loss occurs when memory to hold queued packets fills up
    ▪ arriving packets dropped(loss) if no free buffers



                                                SECURITY

Lines of defense:
    ▪ authentication: proving you are the person who you say you are
    ▪ confidentiality: via encryption
    ▪ integrity checks: digital signatures prevent/detect tampering
    ▪ access restrictions: password-protected VPNs
    ▪ firewalls: specialized “middleboxes” in access and core networks


                                                    

                                    What is the five-layer internet protocol stack?

There are five layers in the internet protocol stack, as shown in the below:
    ▪ Application Layer
    ▪ Transport Layer
    ▪ Network Layer
    ▪ Link Layer
    ▪ Physical Layer

Application Layer:
    Application layer is responsible for communicating between 
    server and different applications like browsers, email, etc
    
    Prodtocols used in application layer:
        ▪ Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): for transferring HTML web documents
        ▪ File Transfer Protocol (FTP): fro transferring files
        ▪ Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): for transferring e-mail messages
        ▪ Domain Name Systems (DNS): for translation human-friendly domain names into IP addresses

Transport Layer:
    Transport layer is responsible for collecting all relevant informations
    and transport this messages to relevant end-point and transferring it
    to the network layer

    The two important protocols used in the transport layer:
        ▪ Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): for reliable and connection-oriented data transfer
        ▪ User Datagram Protocol (UDP): for fast, unreliable, and connection-less data transfer

    Connection-oriented means that TCP establishes the connection  first and then
    transmits data. UDP is connection-less, which means that it just sends the data
    without checking if it is being received or not.


Network layer:
    This layer uses IP(Internet Protocol) predominantly to find the correct network 
    where the destination node is present through Routers which connects .
    
    Another protocol used at this layer for error-reporting is the Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP). 

Link layer:
    data transfer between neighboring network elements


Physical layer:
    The physical layer is responsible for breaking the data frame into bits, 
    converting it into a form that can be transmitted over the physical communication line, and transferring it.

                                            Transmission Modes

▪ Transmission mode(aka communication mode) means transferring data between two devices
▪ There are three types of transmission mode:
    • Simplex Mode
    • Half-Duplex Mode
    • Full-Duplex Mode



Simplex Mode:
    ▪ communication is unidirectional, as on a one-way street.
    ▪ Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive.
    ▪ The simplex mode can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction.
    ▪ Example: Keyboard and traditional monitors. 
    The keyboard can only introduce input, the monitor can only give the output.

Half-Duplex Mode:
  ▪ Each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.
    When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa.
    ▪ It is used in cases where there is no need for communication in both
    directions at the same time. 
    ▪ Example: Walkie-talkie in which message is sent one at a time and
    messages are sent in both directions.

Full-Duplex Mode:
    ▪ Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.
    ▪ Full-duplex mode is used when communication in both directions is required all the time
    ▪ Example: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by
    a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at the same time

                                Difference between Unicast, Broadcastand Multicast

Unicast:
    ▪ This type of information transfer is usefull when there is
    a participation of a single sender and single recipient.
    ▪ One-to-one transmission.
    ▪ This is the most common form of data transfer over the networks.

Broadcast:
    ▪ This is useful when a device in one network wants to transfer packet stream to 
    all the devices over the other network

Multicast:
    ▪ one/more senders and one/more recipients participate in data transfer traffic.
    ▪ IP multicast requires support of some other protocols like 
    IGMP(Internet Group Management Protocol), Multicast routing for its working.

                                    Types of area networks 

▪ LAN, MAN, and WAN are the three major types of networks designed to
operate over the area they cover. There are some similarities and dissimilarities between them.
    • One of the major differences is the geographical area they cover, i.e. LAN covers the
    smallest area; MAN covers an area larger than LAN and WAN comprises the largest of all. 

▪ There are other types of Computer Networks also, like:
    • PAN (Personal Area Network)
    • SAN (Storage Area Network)
    • EPN (Enterprise Private Network)
    • VPN (Virtual Private Network)


Local Area Network:
    ▪ LAN or Local Area Network connects network devices in such a way
    that personal computers and workstations can share data, tools, and programs. 
    ▪ The group of computers or devices are connected together by a switch or
    stack of switches using private addressing scheme as defined by the TCP/IP protocol
    ▪ Routers are found at the boundary of a LAN, connecting them to the larger WAN.
    ▪ LANs cover a smaller geographical area(size is limited to a few kilometers) 
    and are privately owned.
    ▪ One can use it for an office building, home, hospital, schools, etc. 
    ▪ A LAN typically relies mostly on wired connections for increased
    speed and security, but wireless connections can also be part of a LAN.


Metropolitan Area Network:
    ▪ MAN or Metropolitan area Network covers a larger area than that of a
    LAN and smaller area as compared to WAN.
    ▪ It connects two or more computers that are apart but reside in the same
    or different cities.
    ▪ Speeds of MAN range in terms of Mbps.
    ▪ It’s hard to design and maintain a Metropolitan Area Network.

Wide Area Network:
    ▪ WAN or Wide Area Network is a computer network that extends
    over a large geographical area, although it might be confined within
    the bounds of a state or country. 
    ▪ The technology is high speed and relatively expensive.
    ▪ WAN is difficult to design and maintain.
