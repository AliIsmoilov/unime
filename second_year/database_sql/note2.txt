                                GRANT and REVOKE


Grant: 
    SQL Grant command is specifically used to provide privileges 
    to database objects for a user. 
    This command also allows users to grant permissions to other users too. 

Syntax: 
    grant privilege_name on object_name
    to {user_name | public | role_name} 


Revoke : 
    Revoke command withdraw user privileges on database objects if any granted. 
    It does operations opposite to the Grant command. 
    When a privilege is revoked from a particular user U, 
    then the privileges granted to all other users by user U will be revoked. 

Syntax: 
    revoke privilege_name on object_name
    from {user_name | public | role_name}



EXAMPLE:  
    
    grant insert, 
    select on accounts to Ram

on accounts database object like he can query or insert into accounts. 

    revoke insert, 
    select on accounts from Ram
